# K-Nearest-Neighbors-algorithm
K-Nearest Neighbors is a machine learning technique and algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. 
K-Nearest Neighbors examines the labels of a chosen number of data points surrounding a target data point, in order to make a prediction about the class that the data point falls into. 
This Machine Learning project aims to develop an algorithm that classifies breast cancer as benign or malignant. Created on the jupyter notebook with the supervised KNN algorithm (K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm), where it is using a data set found in Kaggle called “Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set”.
